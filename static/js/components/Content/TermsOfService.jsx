          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            We may retain the Age Restricted Items if proof of age or an alternative adult (with
            proof of age, if requested) is not available.
          </li>
          <li>
            At our discretion we may also remove the Age Restricted Items and hand over the

        <p>Availability of Goods and Substitutions</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Availability of goods will depend on stock in the Selected Store at the time of
            purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where an item you have chosen is unavailable (and you have not opted out of us providing
            you with a suitable alternative) we will substitute the item with an alternative.
            However, this may affect the price you pay (see clause 9.2). You will be notified of any
            alternatives and the total price charged in your delivery or collection email.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may refuse any substituted item on delivery or collection and we will refund you for

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Price</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The price of any of the goods you order will be at the price on the Website at the time
            you place your order. If a price change such as a promotion, is put in place after you
            have placed your order, these will not be applied to your order.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may require the total cost of the goods you order in a single order to be equal to,
            or more than, a certain amount (which we refer to as a &lsquo;minimum basket
            spend&rsquo;. Please see the <a href="https://shop.coop.co.uk/faq">FAQs</a> section for
            details of our current minimum basket spend.

          <li>The prices for all goods on the website are inclusive of VAT.</li>
          <li>
            For goods sold by weight such as fruit and vegetables, it is difficult for us to select
            them to an exact weight when we are putting your order together therefore, the item we
            select for you may be more or less in weight. This means you may be charged more or less
            than the price stated on the Website for these goods. We will always try our best to get
            as near as possible to the weight you have ordered.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may
            be incorrectly priced. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is
            obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a
            mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the
            return of any goods provided to you.
