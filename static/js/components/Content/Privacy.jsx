    <h1>Privacy notice</h1>
    <p>
      This privacy notice sets out details of the information we collect about you, how we may use
      it, how we ensure it’s kept secure, who we share it with, and what rights you may have in
      respect of that information.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        We mainly use your personal information to provide our services to you, to meet our legal
        obligations, and to help improve our interests.
      </li>
      <li>We only want to hold as much personal information as we need to do the above.</li>
      <li>
        We want our personal information relationship to be reciprocal where we both benefit, not an
        exploitative one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where we share your data, we only do so with organisations who have a right to see it and
        who will use it fairly.
      </li>
      <li>We take security seriously.</li>
      <li>
        You can contact us at anytime about anything relating to this notice or the information we
        hold about you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      This Notice applies to all the entities within the Co-operative Group Limited (“we”, “us” and
      “The Co-op”) to the extent that they are controllers of your personal information.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re committed to respecting the information you trust us with and making sure that we keep
      it safe. The Co-op has a family of businesses including Food, Insurance, Legal Services,
      Funeralcare and Health.
    </p>
    <h2>Why we ask for your personal information</h2>
    <h3>Where we need your information to do what we’ve promised</h3>

    <p>
      Our main use of your information is where it’s necessary to supply you with our products and
      services, or where it’s necessary as part of the management of our Membership programme.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, we’d need your name, address and payment details when you join as a Member so we
      can:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>register your share in the Co-op</li>
      <li>send your Membership card</li>
      <li>take your £1</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where we need your personal information to help us get better at everything we do</h3>
    <p>
      These are things we consider to be our legitimate interests, some of which are more relevant
      to certain Co-op Group businesses than others.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Developing an understanding of the activities, preferences, and requirements of our Members
        and Customers. For example, we’ll track activity on our website{' '}
        <a href="https://www.coop.co.uk/terms/cookies">using cookies</a> to understand the pages
        people visit so we can offer the best layout of our site. Sometimes we’ll contact you to
        seek feedback on a product or service you’ve requested.
      </li>
      <li>
        For statistical analysis to improve existing products and services and develop new products
        and services.
      </li>
      <li>
        To better understand the common and more general needs of our customers and members. This
        helps us make sure we offer the right products and services and generally meet the needs of
        our Members. For example, it’s really useful for us to look at large sets of data to
        understand whether we’re better stocking skimmed or semi-skimmed milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        To give you a better and more personalised experience (this is sometimes referred to as
        ’profiling’). For example when you sign in to your Co-op Membership account, we might show
        you different content depending on what we know about you. Similarly, if we’d like to give
        you a money off voucher at the till, we’d prefer to use your personal details to try and
        give you a coupon that we think you’re more likely to use. So if you buy a lot of apples, we
        might give you vouchers for apples (and not oranges). Sometimes, we’ll probably make some
        wrong assumptions about you and we’re really sorry about that. For example, maybe you’d
        prefer us to give vouchers for things you haven’t tried rather than the things we think you
        want them for.
      </li>
      <li>
        Communicating with you about the products and services we’re providing to you. We may use
        your personal details to send you things we think you need to know about and things we are
        obliged to send you legally. We broadly term these “service” emails. For example we send
        Members details about things like changes to the benefits they get from membership. We may
        also send individual Members timely information we think they need to help them, for example
        when they have unsuccessfully attempted to sign-in to their account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Promoting, marketing and advertising our products and services. For example, we might look
        at a combination of your personal information to try and determine where we might be best
        placing a television or press advert.
      </li>
      <li>
        To obtain feedback on our performance, to assess customer service and satisfaction and to
        improve overall operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Running checks for identification, creditworthiness and price setting against databases such
        as our Co-op Membership database, which contains information about our Members and how they
        use their Co-op Membership cards, the electoral register and other databases that contain
        publicly available information about County Court judgments, bankruptcy and repossessions.
      </li>
      <li>Managing services or insurance policies.</li>
      <li>
        Where you make a complaint, to handle that complaint and ensure that we are in the best
        position to address the issues you raise.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other ways we might use your personal information</h3>
    <p>We may also need to process your personal data from time to time where necessary for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Preventing and detecting crime or anti-social behaviour. For example, we’ll use CCTV in our
        buildings.
      </li>
      <li>Dealing with any legal claims.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If we’re using your personal information in the above ways, we really understand that your
      data has a value and therefore we try to use it for everyone’s benefit. We also try really
      hard to ensure there will be little or no negative impact on you. This is part of our
      commitment to ensure that we consider all privacy concerns at the earliest possible
      opportunity.
    </p>

    <h2>Our legal basis for using your information</h2>
    <p>We will only use your personal information where:</p>

    <h3>We have your consent</h3>
    <p>
      For example we might rely on your consent in order to send you direct marketing
      communications. Where we do, you can withdraw your consent at any time.
    </p>
    <h3>It’s necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests</h3>

    <p>
      These interests are set out above (see ’Where we need your personal information to help us get
      better at everything we do’), and we will only use such data where those interests are not
      outweighed by your own interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
    </p>

    <h3>It’s necessary for the performance of a contract</h3>
    <p>
      Either when we’re in a contract with you or to take steps as requested by you prior to
      entering into a contract.
    </p>
    <h3>It’s necessary for compliance with a legal obligation we have</h3>
    <h3>To protect your vital interests</h3>

    <p>
      For example if we needed to share your information with a health professional because you’d
      fallen ill.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that where we require you to provide certain information in order to perform our
      contractual obligations and you decline to do so, this may delay our performance of the
      contract or prevent us from honouring our contractual obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>The types of information we hold about you</h2>
    <p>
      Almost all of the information we have is the information you’ve given to us. That might be
      when you request a product, service, offers or news from us via our website, emails, telephone
      conversations, and written and verbal communication.
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously the types of information you give us will vary depending on the service you’ve
      requested but typically could include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>name, address, and contact details</li>
      <li>
        details of products and services you’ve bought from us or, for our health related services,
        details about your health and medication
      </li>
      <li>
        details of your interactions with us through our stores, contact centres, online or by using
        one of our apps
      </li>
      <li>payment details</li>
      <li>call recordings</li>
      <li>information about how you interact with our communications</li>
      <li>visual images, personal appearance and behaviour (usually obtained from CCTV images)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As well as obtaining information from you, we may also collect it from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>someone else acting on your behalf who gives us the information directly</li>
      <li>other Co-op Group companies such as Co-op Insurance, Funeralcare, Food and Health</li>
      <li>publicly available sources such as social media and the electoral register</li>
      <li>fraud prevention and detection agencies, organisations and databases</li>
      <li>government and law enforcement agencies and regulators</li>
      <li>NHS organisations and systems such as your GP and Summary Card Record</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It’s also possible we might process other types of information that might be considered even
      more private, such as information relating to criminal offences and alleged offences. For
      example, if you wanted a quote for a Motor Insurance product we might need to ask about any
      criminal offences or health conditions. These are considered “special categories” of personal
      information and we’re obliged to handle this information even more thoughtfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      See a full list of special category information on{' '}
      <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/">

      </a>

    </p>

    <h3>Sharing your personal information</h3>
    <p>
      When we share your information, we only do so in accordance with our legal, data protection
      and privacy obligations.
    </p>

    <p>Your information may be disclosed to the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service providers.</strong> We use a number of other organisations who carry out
        work on our behalf to help us provide our products and services. We ensure any third parties
        we may share your data with have at least the same privacy and security standards as
        ourselves and will only use your information for the specific reasons we ask them to.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Companies, brands and businesses within the Co-operative Group.</strong> We may also
        share information throughout the Co-op for the reasons outlined such as core administration
        and activities that have been identified as being within our legitimate interests. For
        example, we’ll share information from our Co-op Food stores and other businesses with our
        Membership department to ensure you receive your Membership rewards and there are similar
        arrangements between our other businesses. We may also share information where we decide to
        restructure part of our business and, for example, we transfer responsibility for the
        services we provide to you to another business within the Co-op Group - these entities are
        the same as those listed as controllers in this notice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Credit reference agencies.</strong> For example they may supply anti-fraud and
        credit-insight information to us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social media companies and our advertising partners.</strong> For example we might
        match your email address with Facebook and Twitter to enable us to run promotions on their
        platforms
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Our regulators.</strong> For example, we may need to share your information with the
        Solicitors Regulation Authority or the Legal Ombudsman if we are providing legal services to
        you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Our professional advisors.</strong> For example we may need to share information
        with our lawyers or auditors when they need it to give us their professional advice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Public authorities, agencies and other government bodies.</strong> For example we
        might need to provide your information to the police or other bodies such as the DVLA, the
        NHS Business Services Authority or your GP.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Potential corporate buyers.</strong>Where we consider selling any of our Co-op Group
        businesses or substantially all of its assets to a third party outside the Co-op group. We
        may need to disclose documentation and other information that may include your personal
        information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How long we keep personal information</h2>
    <p>
      We only keep your information for as long as it’s needed for each of the activities we’ve
      identified in this Notice, as well as for as long as required in connection with our legal or
      regulatory obligations.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you might expect, that will vary but we’re happy to share more specific retention schedules
      if you wish to contact us on the contact details below.
    </p>

    <h3>Transferring your information outside the European Economic Area (EEA)</h3>
    <p>
      We may need to transfer your personal information outside of the EEA in order to provide you
      with the services and products you require or as necessary for our business. This will most
      likely occur when our third-party providers are based outside the EEA. Some of these countries
      may not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the EEA.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we do transfer your personal information to other jurisdictions, we will take proper steps
      to ensure that your information is as equally protected as in the UK, such as entering into
      “standard data protection clauses” with the recipient. These are clauses that have been
      approved by the European Commission for such transfers.
    </p>
    <h2>Your rights about how your personal information is handled</h2>

    <p>Data protection laws provide you with a number of rights as set out below.</p>

    <h3>Right to access your personal data</h3>
    <p>
      You may request confirmation that we hold personal data about you, as well as access to a copy
      of any such data.
    </p>

    <h3>Right to rectification</h3>
    <p>You may ask us to rectify any inaccurate information we hold about you.</p>

    <h3>Right to erasure</h3>
    <p>You may ask us to delete your personal information.</p>

    <h3>Right to restriction</h3>
    <p>
      You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information in certain
      circumstances.
    </p>

    <h3>Right to portability</h3>
    <p>
      You may request the receipt or transfer to another organisation in a structured, commonly used
      and machine-readable form, the personal data that you have provided to us.
    </p>

    <h3>Right to object</h3>
    <p>You may object to our processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.</p>

    <h3>Right to withdraw consent</h3>
    <p>
      Where our processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you may withdraw
      this consent at any time, although this won’t affect the lawfulness of any prior processing
      where we relied on your consent.
    </p>

    <h3>Right to make a complaint</h3>
    <p>
      You may make a complaint about our processing of your personal data by contacting us via the
      contact details provided in this Notice. While we hope that we would be able to address any
      issues you have in respect of this processing, you may also make a complaint to the UK’s data
      protection regulation - visit the{' '}
      <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">Information Commissioner’s Office</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please contact us using the contact details
      set out below.
    </p>

    <h3>Automated processing</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes we use your personal information in automated processes to make decisions about you,
      or to create a profile of you. If you are a Member, we may also generate a profile ‘score’ for
      you, which is designed to provide benefits such as discounts on Co-op products and services.
      Our use of automated decision making, for example in respect of our insurance products, is to
      help ensure that decisions are made accurately, fairly and efficiently.
    </p>

      our response can be.

      the right to object to profiling and the right to ask us to delete your information.
